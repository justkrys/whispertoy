# whispertoy

Playing around with OpenAI's Whisper model.

## Prerequisites

- ffmpeg (apt install ffmpeg or whatever)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Dev setup

```sh
poetry install
pip install whisper
```

**NOTE:** Poetry does not properly install Whisper's dependencies, hence the next for the extra pip install.
